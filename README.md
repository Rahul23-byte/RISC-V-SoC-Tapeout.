# RISC-V-SoC-Tapeout.
This repository documents my journey through the RTL to GDSII SoC Design Program organized by VSD (VLSI System Design) under the RISC-V India initiative. 
The program is focused on taking a digital design from Register Transfer Level (RTL) all the way to a final GDSII layout ready for tape-out, using open-source EDA tools.
