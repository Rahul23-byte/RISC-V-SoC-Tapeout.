⚡ RTL2GDS Journey — SoC Tapeout with VSD & RISC-V

👋 Welcome! This repository records my week-by-week progress as I take part in the RISC-V SoC Tapeout Program organized by VLSI System Design (VSD).

🚀 The program takes us through the complete ASIC design flow, from RTL coding all the way to a GDSII layout ready for tapeout — powered entirely by open-source EDA tools.

🌟 About the Program

💡 “From RTL to Silicon — building chips with open-source tools and collective knowledge.”

This initiative is part of India’s largest RISC-V collaborative tapeout, bringing together 3500+ participants to contribute towards the nation’s growing semiconductor ecosystem.

📖 Learning Roadmap

RTL → Synthesis → Floorplanning → Placement → Routing → GDSII (Tapeout Ready)

📝 RTL Design – Building logic at register transfer level

🔄 Synthesis – Converting RTL into gate-level netlist (Yosys)

🏗️ Physical Design – Floorplanning, placement, routing (OpenLane, Magic)

✅ Verification – Simulation & debugging (Icarus Verilog, GTKWave, NgSpice)

🎯 RISC-V Reference SoC Tapeout Program VSD
