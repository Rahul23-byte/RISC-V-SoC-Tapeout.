# ⚡ RISC-V Reference SoC Tapeout Program VSD

👋 Welcome! This repository records my progress as I take part in the **RISC-V SoC Tapeout Program** organized by **VLSI System Design (VSD)**.  

🚀 The program takes us through the complete **ASIC design flow**, from **RTL coding** all the way to a **GDSII layout** ready for tapeout — powered entirely by **open-source EDA tools**.

## 🌟 About the Program  

💡 *“From RTL to Silicon — building chips with open-source tools and collective knowledge.”*  

This initiative is part of **India’s largest RISC-V collaborative tapeout**, bringing together **3500+ participants** to contribute towards the nation’s growing semiconductor ecosystem.

## 📖 Learning Roadmap  

**RTL → Synthesis → Floorplanning → Placement → Routing → GDSII (Tapeout Ready)**  

- 📝 **RTL Design** – Building logic at register transfer level  
- 🔄 **Synthesis** – Converting RTL into gate-level netlist (Yosys)  
- 🏗️ **Physical Design** – Floorplanning, placement, routing (OpenLane, Magic)  
- ✅ **Verification** – Simulation & debugging (Icarus Verilog, GTKWave, NgSpice)  
- 🎯 **Tapeout Preparation** – Generating the final GDSII

## 🎓 Skills & Tools  

- **Tools:** Yosys, OpenLane, Magic VLSI, Icarus Verilog, GTKWave, NgSpice, Docker  
- **Concepts:** ASIC design flow, timing analysis, design verification  
- **Industry Relevance:** Hands-on exposure to **real-world chip design** using accessible, open-source methods
