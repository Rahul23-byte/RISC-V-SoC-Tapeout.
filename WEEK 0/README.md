<div align="center">

</div>

Welcome to my **VLSI System Design (VSD) Program** repository! This week focused on setting up the development environment and installing the essential open-source tools that will be used throughout the program. The goal was to create a reliable and efficient workspace for synthesis, simulation, and design tasks.

| **Specification** 💻    | **Details** 📋          |
|------------------------|------------------------|
| **Operating System** 🐧 | Ubuntu 20.04+         |
| **RAM** 💾              | 6GB                   |
| **Storage** 💿          | 50GB HDD              |
| **vCPUs** ⚡            | 4                     |
