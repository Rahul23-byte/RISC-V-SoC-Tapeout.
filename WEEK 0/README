# 🏗️ VLSI System Design (VSD) – Week 0 Setup  

## 📌 Overview  

Welcome to my **VLSI System Design (VSD) Program** repository!  
This week focuses on setting up a **stable development environment** and installing the essential **open-source VLSI tools**.  

**Objectives:**  
- ✔️ Build a reliable workspace  
- ✔️ Prepare for synthesis, simulation, and design tasks  
- ✔️ Verify each tool installation successfully

## 💻 Virtual Machine Configuration  

For smooth operation, the VM was set up with the following specifications:  

| Component | Configuration |
|-----------|---------------|
| OS 🐧     | Ubuntu 20.04+ |
| RAM 💾    | 6 GB          |
| Disk 💿   | 50 GB HDD     |
| CPU ⚡    | 4 vCPUs       |

💡 This setup ensures enough resources to handle simulations, synthesis, and layout tools efficiently.

## 🔧 Tools Installed  

The following open-source tools were installed for this program:  

1. **Yosys** – RTL synthesis  
2. **Iverilog** – Verilog simulation  
3. **GTKWave** – Waveform visualization  
4. **Ngspice** – Circuit simulation  
5. **Magic VLSI** – Layout editing & DRC
