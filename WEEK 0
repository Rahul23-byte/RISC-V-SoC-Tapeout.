Week 0 — Description & Purpose

In Week 0, my goal was to lay the groundwork for the rest of the RTL-to-GDSII design flow. This means setting up all required tools, verifying the environment, and making sure I understand the flow and roles of each component. The content in this folder captures what I did, what I learned, and the state of my setup.

What is in this Folder

Installation logs / screenshots of tools like Yosys, Icarus Verilog, Magic VLSI, OpenLane, etc.

Configuration files (if any), environment checks, version outputs to verify that each tool is working.

README with notes about what tools were installed, what worked, any difficulties encountered.

Images or diagrams showing tool logos, possibly flow-diagram of the ASIC design pipeline (RTL → Synthesis → Placement/Routing → GDSII).

Why It’s Important

Ensures reproducibility: someone else can look at this and see exactly what tools & versions I used.

Helps me troubleshoot later: if something fails in synthesis or layout, I have a reference of what my baseline was.

Provides clarity: understanding what each tool does and how they fit into the overall ASIC pipeline.
